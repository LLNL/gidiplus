# GIDI+

**GIDI+** is a collection of C++ libraries for accessing evaluated and processed nuclear data stored in the 
Generalized Nuclear Database Structure (**GNDS**).  In addition to reading **GNDS** files, **GIDI+** has functions to 
sum and collapse multi-group data as needed by deterministic transport codes, and to sample **GNDS** data as needed by
Monte Carlo transport codes.

# Dependency

**GIDI+** requires the third party library pugixml version 1.13.  If pugixml is not already present in the **GIDI+ Misc**
directory, download it from https://pugixml.org/2022/11/02/pugixml-1.13-release.html and place it in the 'Misc' folder.

# Installation

To clone the **GIDI+** Git repository the following command is recommended:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules ssh://git@czgitlab.llnl.gov:7999/nuclear/gidiplus/gidiplus.git
```

**NOTE:**
If you have an older version of git (2.2 or lower), use `git lfs clone` instead of `git clone`.
This is unnecessary on newer versions of git since they handle lfs (Large File Storage) automatically.

Currently, **GIDI+** uses the **unix make** command to build and puts needed header and library files into the *include* and
*lib* directories, respecitively. Important targets in the Makefile are:

| Target     | Description
|------------|------------
| default:   | Builds libgidiplus.a (and all other libraries) and puts them into the 'lib' directory. Puts all needed header files into the 'include' directory.
| install:   | Copies the header files from the 'include' directory to '$(PREFIX)/include'. Copies all '.a' from the 'lib' directory to '$(PREFIX)/lib.'
| bin:       | Compiles binary utilities for testing processed GNDS files in PoPI/bin, GIDI/bin and MCGIDI/bin.
| check:     | Runs the tests in all the sub-libraries. This target requires that the test data have been installed.
| realclean: | Returns **GIDI+** back to its initial state (i.e., removes all files created by the other targets).

**GIDI+** uses features from the 2011 C++ standard, so it must be compiled with *-std=c++11* or newer. The Makefile selects c++11 by default,
or if desired a newer version of the standard can be selected by setting the CXXFLAGS when calling make.
**GIDI+** supports parallel compilation using the '-j' flag:
```
make -s -j   # compile with default C++ 2011
# or
make -s -j CXXFLAGS="-std=c++17"
```

For building executables and running the tests, this would look like:
```
make -s -j bin
make -s -j check
```

One may specify the CC and CXX compilers and their flags when building. For example,
```
make default CC=g++ CXX=g++ CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11 -g -O3" CFLAGS="-std=gnu11 -g -O3"
```

To put the results into the path */path/to/my/builds*, execute
```
make install CC=gcc CXX=g++ CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11 -g -O3" CFLAGS="-std=gnu11 -g -O3" PREFIX=/path/to/my/builds
```

If one is using mixed **XML/HDF5 GNDS** files, **HDF5** must be included when building and linking. This is done by specifying the location
of **HDF5** with the *HDF5_PATH* macro. For example, if **HDF5** is installed on the system, them the following may work:
```
make -s CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11" HDF5_PATH=/usr
```

On some systems, the default **HDF5** library was compiled for 32-bit execution. To link in with a 64-bit library one also needs
to specify the path to the 64-bit libraries. For example,
```
make -s CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11" HDF5_PATH=/usr HDF5_LIB=/usr/lib64
```

Comments for compiling on LLNL LC systems:

A set of bash scripts for building on LC systems can be found in the *Scripts* directory.
These scripts first define some environment varibles before executing **make**.

# Working with Git submodules

**GIDI+** is composed of submodules that are hosted in their own repositories and Git keeps a record of this in the following files:

- .gitmodules which contains the local, relative path to the submodules and the URL to the corresponding 
        remote repositories; and

- files, containing the commit hash for the version used in **GIDI+**, for each submodule.

Consequently, **GIDI+** points to a specific version of each submodule while code updates in the individual submodules continue independently. 
The submodules may also be in a state called *detached HEAD* which indicates that **GIDI+** is not associated with a submodule's local branch name. 
This may be observed via the output from the following command:
```
git submodule foreach 'git status'
```

The output for a given submodule may contain the string *HEAD detached* (indicating a submodule in the *detached HEAD* state) or 
*Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'*. If no code updates are to be done in a submodule in the *HEAD detached* state, no further 
action is required. If a submodule is to be updated, it will need to be associated with a branch that contains the commit to which **GIDI+**
points. For example, to associate **GIDI** with the master branch use the command:
```
cd GIDI; git checkout master
```

or to associated all submodules with master, use
```
git submodule foreach 'git checkout master'
```

These commands will associate the submodule(s) with the latest commit in that branch and this may not correspond to the submodule commit to which 
**GIDI+** is pointing. The following command provides the commit hash identifier that **GIDI+** points at for each of the submodules:
```
git ls-tree -r HEAD | grep commit
```

To list the commit identifiers for the currently checked-out submodules, the following command may be used:
```
git submodule foreach 'git rev-parse HEAD'
```

A difference in commit hash identifiers will indicate a difference between the currently checked-out version of the submodule and the version to 
which **GIDI+** is pointing. The command `git status` in the **GIDI+** folder will also indicate if the file associated with the submodule is in 
the modified state.

It is obviously important that any code updates to the submodule be `git push` before the corresponding **GIDI+** `git push` command. This prevents 
future **GIDI+** repository checkouts that point to a non-existent submodule commit hash identifier.
