Description:
    The test1 checker.

positional arguments:
  fourScore                   Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation,
                              conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  Now
                              we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived
                              and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have
                              come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave
                              their lives that the nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should
                              do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not
                              hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated
                              it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long
                              remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the
                              living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have
                              thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task
                              remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause
                              for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that
                              these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new
                              birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall
                              not perish from the earth.
  GNDS                        The path to a GNDS file to load. This is a very very long discriptor. It should cause line
                              wrapping. Ok, may it needs to longer and longer and longer.
  name [2,2]                  Short discriptor.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                  Show this help message and exit.
  --true, -t, -y, -yes, --yeap
                              Testing the 'OptionTrue' class.
  --false                     Testing the 'OptionFalse' class.
  --veryVeryLongCounterNameVeryVeryLong
                              A very long counter name, very long.
  --store VALUE               The path to a pops file to load.
  --pops, -p, -pops VALUE [0,-1]
                              The path to a pops file to load.
  --p24 VALUE [2,4]           Option that requires 2 to 4 instances.
