/* Modified from Karsten Burger's version 2017
 * Made changes to make it more compatible with GPUs.
 * Allow for data to be initialized to nullptr.
 *
 * Modified from public domain software:
 * Karsten Burger 2014
 *
 * Sourceforge project "Simple C++ String Class"
 * http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplecstringclass/

 * This a simple C++ string class based on class my_string by
 * Christian Stigen Larsen, 2007, http://csl.name/programming/my_string/
 *
 * It only uses the C-string functions and is thus independent of the
 * standard C++ library.
 *
 * It is public domain, in the hope, that you find it useful.
 * Please note that there is no guarantee of any kind: it is supplied
 * without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of
 * merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
 *
 * You can probably replace std::string with this one in many
 * cases, but a lot of stuff is missing, and I would recommend
 * you stick to std::string anyway.
 *
 * I want to point out that there is nothing fancy about this class.
 * It keeps every string in its own buffer, and copies as often as
 * needed.
 * The data always contains a trailing NUL char.
 *
 * However, I believe that is a good approach.  For instance, it
 * uses malloc rather than new, which makes it possible to use
 * realloc.  On many systems, realloc will try to use up "invisible"
 * space that was used by malloc to pad a string for memory alignment.
 * That makes it potentially fast for small concatenations.
 *
 * I don't propose to use this class for anything practical, since
 * we already have std::string, but it may be an interesting read
 * for C++ novices at the very least. Also, additional functions can
 * easily be expanded.
 *
 * Also I met a case, where I had to avoid std::string because of
 * link problems with an application using mixed libraries, especially
 * one compiled with an old Intel compiler icc 7.
 *
 * Bugs/suggestions to info [at) dr-burger ]dot[ com
 * or via the Sourceforge project page.
