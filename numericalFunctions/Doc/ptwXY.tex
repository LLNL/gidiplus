\section{Introduction}
The \highlight{ptwXY} C object (i.e., an instance of C typedef \highlight{ptwXYPoints}) and supporting C functions are designed to 
handle point-wise interpolative data representing a mathematical function\footnote{By definition, a mathematical function is
single valued which requires that $x_{i} < x_{i+1}$ if $y_i$ is not equal to $y_{i+1}$. Since $x_{i} == x_{i+1}$ if $y_i == y_{i+1}$ adds nothing
but complexity, $x_{i}$ must always be less than $x_{i+1}$. The case $x_{i} > x_{i+1}$ for all $i$ would also work as
a mathematical function; but, supporting both the cases $x_{i} < x_{i+1}$ for all $i$ and $x_{i} > x_{i+1}$ for all $i$ would make the \highlight{ptwXYPoints} coding harder, 
is also not allowed.} of one independent variable (i.e., y = f(x)). That is, a \highlight{ptwXY} object consist of an 
list of pairs ($x_i,y_i$) where $x_{i} < x_{i+1}$ and $y_i = f(x_i)$. Henceforth, the \highlight{ptwXY} C object
and supporting C functions are called the \highlight{ptwXY} model. Routines supporting common operations 
on the points of f(x) are included in this package. As example, a function exists to add two \highlight{ptwXY} instances returning the sum
as a \highlight{ptwXY} instances (i.e., $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$ where $f(x)$, $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ 
are all \highlight{ptwXY} objects). The main intent for developing this library is for a fast XY math object for LLNL's FUDGE package
which manipulates nuclear data (e.g., it can be used to add cross section from different reactions). However,
this library may be useful for other packages.

As example of the usage of \highlight{ptwXY} objects consider the data in Table~\ref{B1Pop}. 
This table list the male and female populations of a
bird species on an island for several census years. In this example, $x_i$ represents
a census year and $y_i$ represents the population for that year. Note that the male population is not
given for the year 1885. 

\begin{table}

\end{center}
\caption{Male and female populations of a bird species on an island for the years census were taken. There was
no census taken of the male population in 1885. \label{B1Pop}}
\end{table}

A portion of a C function to put the male and female 
populations into \highlight{ptwXY} objects and add them together to get the total population is shown in Table~\ref{B1Code}.
In this example no error checking is shown. 
The output of this code, compressed into fewer lines, is show in Table~\ref{B1Output}.

The function \highlight{ptwXY\_new2} allocates memory for
a new \highlight{ptwXYPoints} object, initializes it and returns a pointer to the object. The second
argument of this function in an interpolation flag. For all other arguments see Section~\ref{ptwXYnewSec}. The
function \highlight{ptwXY\_setXYData} takes a pointer to a \highlight{ptwXYPoints} object as its second argument and copies 
the list of doubles given by the fourth argument into the \highlight{ptwXYPoints} object's internal memory, deleting
any data currently in the object. 
The third argument is the number of pairs of points in the fourth argument's data. 

The function \highlight{ptwXY\_add\_ptwXY} takes a \highlight{ptwXYPoints} object
as its second and third arguments, and returns a new \highlight{ptwXYPoints} object that is the sum. 
The summed object's $x$ values are a union between the $x$ value's of the operants.  As can be seen
from the example, this function interpolates to fill in missing data for either data set. That is, the male population
was linear-linear interpolated to give 827 for the year 1885.

\subsection{Important concepts}
This section describes several important concepts and rules that the \highlight{ptwXY} model is build on.

\subsubsection{Mutual domains}
Most functions that have two or more \highlight{ptwXYPoints} instances as input (e.g., ptwXY\_add\_ptwXY, ptwXY\_groupThreeFunctions) require
that their domains be mutual. This section explains why mutual domains are needed and what a mutual domain is.

Consider the two point-wise linear-linear interpolable functions
\begin{verbatim}
        f1 = (1,1), (9,3)
        f2 = (1,2), (9,4).
\end{verbatim}
where a point-wise function with $n$ points is written as
\begin{eqnarray}
        (x_0,y_0), \ (x_1,y_1), \ (x_2,y_2), \ ... \ (x_{n-1},y_{n-1}) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
and each point is the pair $(x_i,y_i)$ with $x_i < x_{i+1}$.
Each of these functions contains only two points. The first has domain $1 \le x \le 9$ with the y-value 
going from 1 to 3 and can be represented symbolically as $y = \rm{f1}(x) = ( x - 1 ) / 4 + 1$ for the domain $1 \le x \le 9$. 
The second has the same domain with the y-value going from 2 to 4 and can be represented symbolically as $y = \rm{f2}(x) = ( x - 1 ) / 4 + 2$. 
The rule that should be implemented for adding these two functions is clear and is
$s(x) = ( x - 1 ) / 2 + 3 = \rm{f1}(x) + \rm{f2}(x)$ or in point-wise form
\begin{verbatim}
        (1,3), (9,7) = f1 + f2
\end{verbatim}
For the domain $1 \le x \le 9$, the point-wise linear-linear interpolable sum and the symbolic sum yield the
same results. For example, both yield $s(3) = 4$. Figure~\ref{sum_f1_f2} graphically shows f1, f2 and f1$ + $f2.
\include{sum_f1_f2}

Now consider the point-wise linear-linear interpolable function
\begin{verbatim}
        f3 = (3,1), (7,3).
\end{verbatim}
This function also contains only two points and has domain $3 \le x \le 7$ with a y-value going of 1 to 3. This function
can be represented symbolically as $y = \rm{f3}(x) = ( x - 3 ) / 2 + 1$. The rule that should be implemented for 
adding f1 and f3 is not obvious. For example, one could implement the rule which makes a union of the x-values 
in f1 and f3 (i.e., 1, 3, 7 and 9),
interpolate each function onto these points using 0 where the function is not defined and then add the y-values.
Let f1' and f3' be the functions f1 and f3 with the union points and the y-values filled in. In
point-wise representation, f1' and f3' are
\begin{verbatim}
        f1' = (1,1), (3,1.5), (7,2.5), (9,3)
        f3' = (1,0), (3,1),   (7,3),   (9,0).
\end{verbatim}
The sum resulting from this rule is then
\begin{verbatim}
        (1,1), (3,2.5), (7,5.5), (9,3) = f1' + f3' = f1 + f3.
\end{verbatim}
and is shown as the blue curve in Fgure~\ref{sum_f1_f3}. The blue curve is not vary appealing in part because for this addition rule the
sum of f3 with f1 makes the assumption that $\rm{f3}(x) = ( x - 1 ) / 2$ for $1 \le x \le 3$.
But what is worse, this rule does not guarantee the associativity rule for addition. To see this, consider the three 
linear-linear point-wise functions
\begin{verbatim}
        g1 = (1,0), (1,1),        (10,10)
        g2 = (1,0),               (10,10)
        g3 =               (2,1), (10,1).
\end{verbatim}
Note that g1 and g2 represent the same function.
The addition $(\rm{g1} + \rm{g2}) + \rm{g3}$ is
\begin{verbatim}
        (0,0), (1,2), (2,5), (10,21) = ( g1 + g2 ) + g3
\end{verbatim}
while the addition $\rm{g1} + (\rm{g2} + \rm{g3})$ is
\begin{verbatim}
        (0,0), (1,2.5), (2,5), (10,21) = g1 + ( g2 + g3 ).
\end{verbatim}
\include{sum_f1_f3}

Another rule one could implement would effectively add a point with $y = 0$ just below the first point of f3,
one just above the last point of f3, one at $x = 1$ and one at $x = 9$ to yield an f3' as
\begin{verbatim}
        f3' = (1,0), (2.99999,0), (3,1), (7,3), (7.00001,0), (9,0).
\end{verbatim}
and the sum f1$ + $f3 would then be
\begin{verbatim}
        (1,1), (2.99999,1.4999975, (3,2.5), (7,5.5), (7.00001, 2.5000025), (9,3)
\end{verbatim}
The sum resulting from this latter rule is shown as the black curve in Fgure~\ref{sum_f1_f3}. This rule looks much better and is.
However, when designing the \highlight{ptwXYPoints} model, this rule was also rejected as it would require the 
\highlight{ptwXYPoints} library to know the appropriate distance below and above the end-points to add 0's.

The rule that the \highlight{ptwXYPoints} model implements is called ``mutual domain''. This rule states that the
domains of the functions operated on must be the same with one exception. This exception will now be explained. 
Let h1 and h2 be two \highlight{ptwXYPoints} instances with
the lower and upper domain limits of h1 being $x_{1,l}$ and $x_{1,u}$ and that of h2 being $x_{2,l}$ and $x_{2,u}$. 
If $x_{1,l} \ne x_{2,l}$ then the y-value for the greater lower-x-limit must be 0. For example, if
$x_{1,l} > x_{2,l}$ then $\rm{h2}(x_{2,l}) = 0$. If $x_{1,u} \ne x_{2,u}$ then the y-value for the lesser
upper-x-limit must be 0. For example, if $x_{1,u} < x_{2,u}$ then $\rm{h1}(x_{1,u}) = 0$. This rule works because
the \highlight{ptwXYPoints} model assumes that if the y-value is 0 at the lower limit, then it is 0 for all
$x$ less than the lower limit. Likewise if the y-value is 0 at the upper limit, then it is 0 for all
$x$ greater than the upper limit.

If f4 and f5 have mutual domains, and f4 and f6 have mutual domains, the it is not guaranteed that f5 and f6
have mutual domains. As an example, let
\begin{verbatim}
        f4 = (1,4), (8,4)
        f5 = (3,0), (8,2)
        f6 = (4,3), (6,0).
\end{verbatim}
Then, f4 and f5 have mutual domains and so do f5 and f6. However, f4 and f6 do not have mutual domains.
Because of this fact, the function \highlight{ptwXY\_groupThreeFunctions} has to check the domains of \highlight{ptwXY1} to 
\highlight{ptwXY2}, \highlight{ptwXY1} to \highlight{ptwXY3} and \highlight{ptwXY2} to \highlight{ptwXY3}. Acutally,
\highlight{ptwXY\_groupThreeFunctions} first limits the domains of \highlight{ptwXY1}, \highlight{ptwXY2} and
\highlight{ptwXY3} to that of \highlight{groupBoundaries} first.
\include{mutualDomain_f4_f5_f6}

\subsubsection{Infill} \label{Infill}
The addition of two linear functions yields another linear function. As example, the sum of $\rm{f1}(x) = s1 \times x + y1$
and $\rm{f2}(x) = s2 \times x + y2$ is
\begin{equation}
    \rm{f1}(x) + \rm{f2}(x) = ( s1 + s2 ) \times x + y1 + y2 \ \ \ \ .
\end{equation}
Hence, when the function \highlight{ptwXY\_add\_ptwXY}
adds two linear-linear pointwise functions, it only needs to make a union of the x-values of the two addends to maintain accuracy.
However, the multiplication of $\rm{f1}(x)$ and $\rm{f2}(x)$ is not a linear function but a quadratic function. For example,
\begin{equation}
\rm{f1}(x) \times \rm{f2}(x) = s1 \times s2 \times x^2 + ( s1 \times y2 + s2 \times y1 ) \times x + y1 \times y2 \ \ \ \ .
\end{equation}
In an attempt to maintain accuracy, the
function \highlight{ptwXY\_mul2\_ptwXY} may add additional points between the union points. For example, consider the following
linear-linear point-wise functions f3 and f4,
\begin{verbatim}
        f3 = (0,0), (1,1)
        f4 = (0,1), (1,0)
\end{verbatim}
which have the symbolic forms $\rm{f3}(x) = x$ and $\rm{f4}(x) = 1 - x$ over the domain $0 \le x \le 1$ and the symbolic
product $x ( 1 - x )$. Making a union of the x-values and evaluating the product on the x-values yields
\begin{verbatim}
    (0,0), (1,0) = f3 * f4
\end{verbatim}
which is clearly inadequate. For this example, the only way to maintain the accuracy is to add points between $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. The adding of
points in an attempt to maintain accuracy is called infilling and is done automatically by some \highlight{ptwXYPoints} functions
including \highlight{ptwXY\_mul2\_ptwXY} but not by \highlight{ptwXY\_mul\_ptwXY}.

Infilling is done by bisecting (i.e., generating the point midway between) two consecutive points and asking if 
the accuracy of the operation (e.g., mutiplication) is satisfied. If the accuracy is satisfied, the midpoint is not added. However, if 
the accurcay is not satisfied, the midpoint is added then the segments on both side of the midpoint are tested. 

In some cases, infilling can add a lot of points, more than one may like. Each \highlight{ptwXYPoints}
instance has a member called \highlight{biSectionMax} to limit bisecting. The union function sets the
\highlight{biSectionMax} of the returned \highlight{ptwXYPoints} instance, to the maximum of \highlight{biSectionMax} of
its inputted \highlight{ptwXYPoints} instances. For each segment of the initial union at most
\highlight{biSectionMax} bisections are performed. Table~\ref{infillCode1} contains a snippet of code which
demonstrates the multiplication f3 and f4, without any error checking of course, for \highlight{biSectionMax}
set to 0, 1, 2, and 3, and Figure~\ref{mul_f3_f4_infill} shows the output from this code.

\begin{table}
\begin{verbatim}
int main( int argc, char **argc ) {

    double f3[4] = { 0., 0., 1., 1. }, f4[4] = { 0., 1., 1., 0. };
    ptwXYPoints *ptwXY3, *ptwXY4;
    ptwXY_interpolation linlin = ptwXY_interpolationLinLin;

    ptwXY3 = ptwXY_create2( NULL, linlin, 10, 10, 2, f3, 0 );
    ptwXY4 = ptwXY_create2( NULL, linlin, 10, 10, 2, f4, 0 );

    doProduct( ptwXY3, ptwXY4, 0 );
    doProduct( ptwXY3, ptwXY4, 1 );
    doProduct( ptwXY3, ptwXY4, 2 );
    doProduct( ptwXY3, ptwXY4, 3 );

}

void doProduct( ptwXYPoints *ptwXY3, ptwXYPoints *ptwXY4, double biSection ) {

    ptwXYPoints *product;

    ptwXY_setBiSectionMax( ptwXY3, biSection );
    product = ptwXY_mul2_ptwXY( NULL, ptwXY3, ptwXY4 );
}
\end{verbatim}
\caption{This table show a snippet of the code used to generate the curves in Figure~\ref{mul_f3_f4_infill}.} \label{infillCode1}
\end{table}
\include{mul_f3_f4_infill}

If infilling is needed, the \highlight{biSectionMax} member of the returned \highlight{ptwXYPoints} instance is reduced by 
$\ln(l_f / l_u) / ln(2)$ where $l_u$ is the lenght of the union and $l_f$ is the final length after all bisections\footnote{This reduction is derived
by setting $2^z = l_f/l_u$ and solving for $z$.}. An \highlight{ptwXYPoints} instance's \highlight{biSectionMax} can be set using
\highlight{ptwXY\_setBiSectionMax} and got using \highlight{ptwXY\_setBiSectionMax}. A \highlight{ptwXYPoints}'s
\highlight{biSectionMax} is limited to the range 0 to \highlight{ptwXY\_maxBiSectionMax}.

\subsubsection{accuracy}
\highlight{FIXME}

For the examples in Table~\ref{infillCode1}, the infill is halted when \highlight{biSectionMax} is met. This is one of two ways that
infill is halted. The other way is when an infill point agrees to the exact solution to a relative accuracy.

\subsubsection{Safe divide}

\highlight{FIXME}

\subsubsection{Future change to \highlight{biSectionMax} and \highlight{accuracy}.}
A future release of this library will change the way \highlight{biSectionMax} and \highlight{accuracy} are handled. Instead of being
associated with each \highlight{ptwXYPoints} instance, they will be associated with the operators (e.g., multiplication and division)
that require them. For example, the members \highlight{accuracy} and \highlight{biSectionMax} will be removed from the
\highlight{ptwXYPoints} struct, and the declaration of \highlight{ptwXY\_mul2\_ptwXY} will change from

\begin{verbatim}
ptwXYPoints *ptwXY_mul2_ptwXY( statusMessageReporting *smr, ptwXYPoints *ptwXY1, 
                               ptwXYPoints *ptwXY2 );
\end{verbatim}

to something like

\begin{verbatim}
ptwXYPoints *ptwXY_mul_ptwXY( statusMessageReporting *smr, ptwXYPoints *ptwXY1, 
                              ptwXYPoints *ptwXY2, double accuracy, 
                              int biSectionMax );
\end{verbatim}

\section{Name convention}

This section defines some of the names used in this document.

\begin{description}
    \item[point:] A point is a pair of $(x,y)$ values.
    \item[cache and array:] In this document there is a distinction between a cache and an array of a cache. A cache 
            is allocated memory used to store data. An array of a cache is a region of a cache containing valid data. As example, 
            for the primary cache described in section~\ref{TCDGArray}, points are added to the cache as needed. The current points 
            in the cache constitute the array of that cache.
\end{description}

\section{Two-cached, Dynamic-Growth Data Array} \label{TCDGArray}
Built into the \highlight{ptwXY} model is the ability to insert a point at any $x$. The supporting functions will
automatically increase the size of an internal data cache if needed to accommodate a new $x$ value. However, to make adding
and deleting points potentially more efficient, the \highlight{ptwXY} model has two data caches, dubbed primary and secondary.
In the primary cache, data are stored in a C array in ascending order which allows for quick accessing. However, inserting a new
$x$ value at any place other than the end of the array can be slow as it requires moving all $x$ values that are greater than the new value
up one element in the array.  To over come this, a newly added $x$ value
is inserted into the secondary cache if: 1) the value cannot be inserted after the last element of the primary array\footnote{A value can
only be inserted after the last element of the primary array if its $x$ is greater than the current maximum $x$ value and there is room in
the primary cache.} and 2) space is available in the secondary cache. The secondary cache is a static, linked list. Here, static means that
the elements of the linked list are allocated during setup so there is no overhead associated with allocating or freeing
elements of the linked list later. Typically, re-allocation
of the memory of the primary cache is only required when a new $x$ value cannot be inserted into either cache.

There are four parameters, two for each cache, that describe the current state of the caches. Each cache has a size which is the 
amount, in units of an element of that cache, of memory allocated for the cache and a length which is the amount, in units of an 
element of that cache, of the cache that is currently used (i.e., the size of the array of that cache).

The initial size of the two caches is set either through the function \highlight{ptwXY\_new} or \highlight{ptwXY\_\-setup} via their
\highlight{primarySize} and \highlight{secondarySize} arguments. The size of the primary and secondary caches can be directly altered after
they have been created via the
functions \highlight{ptwXY\_reallo\-cate\-Points} and \highlight{ptwXY\_\-reallo\-cate\-Overflow\-Points} respectively. 
In general these last two functions should
not be called by the users unless they know that the a cache is woefully too small.

The function \highlight{pwtXY\_coalescePoints} can be called to transfer all secondary points into the primary cache.

\section{ptwXYPoints's C structs, macros and enums}
The following definitions are defined in the C header file ``ptwXY.h''.

\subsection{ptwXYPoints}
The \highlight{ptwXYPoints} type is defined as:
\begin{verbatim}
typedef
    struct ptwXYPoints_s {
        nfu_status status;
        ptwXY_interpolation interpolation;
        char const *interpolationString;
        int userFlag;
        double biSectionMax;
        double accuracy;
        double minFractional_dx;
        int64_t length;
        int64_t allocatedSize;
        int64_t overflowLength;
        int64_t overflowAllocatedSize;
        int64_t mallocFailedSize;
        ptwXYOverflowPoint overflowHeader;
        ptwXYPoint *points;
        ptwXYOverflowPoint *overflowPoints;
    } ptwXYPoints;
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
The \highlight{ptwXYPoint} type is defined as:
\begin{verbatim}
typedef
    struct ptwXYPoint_s {
        double x, y;
    } ptwXYPoint;
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
The type \highlight{ptwXYOverflowPoint} will not be described here as it is not used as an argument in any function and
its members in \highlight{ptwXYPoints} should not be accessed by user codes.

\subsection{C macros}
\highlight{FIXME}

This section lists some of the C macros defined in ``ptwXY.h''.

\subsection{Interpolation} \label{interpolationSection}
For an $x$ value that is within the domain of a \highlight{ptwXYPoints} object but not one of its points, the \highlight{ptwXYPoints} 
functions interpolate, as instructed by the member \highlight{interpolation}, to obtain the $y$ value. Interpolation types are
defined using the type \highlight{ptwXY\_interpolation} which is defined as:
\begin{verbatim}
typedef enum ptwXY_interpolation_e { 
    ptwXY_interpolationLinLin,  /* x and y linear. */
    ptwXY_interpolationLinLog,  /* x linear and y logarithmic. */
    ptwXY_interpolationLogLin,  /* x logarithmic and y linear. */
    ptwXY_interpolationLogLog,  /* x and y logarithmic. */
    ptwXY_interpolationFlat,    /* see below */
    ptwXY_interpolationOther    /* see below */
} ptwXY_interpolation;
\end{verbatim}
\highlight{FIXME}

The latter two interpolation types have many restrictions. For \highlight{ptwXY\_interpolationFlat} the $y$ for $x_i \le x < x_{i+1}$ is $y_i$.
This type is good for storing histogram type data.
Many of the functions in the \highlight{ptwXY} library cannot handle the flat interpolation and return the error
\highlight{nfu\_invalidInterpol-ation} via their nfu\_status argument. The interpolation type \highlight{ptwXY\_interpolationOther}
allows the use of ptwXY storage type for data that does not fit into one the other defined interpolation types. Most
functions cannot handle the other interpolation and also return the error \highlight{nfu\_invalidInterpolation}.

\subsection{Data types}
Currently, the \highlight{ptwXY} model only supports a point as an $(x, y)$ pair. 

\subsection{Miscellaneous types}
The function \highlight{ptwXY\_getPointsAroundX} is used by other functions to determine
where an $x$ value fits into a \highlight{ptwXYPoints} object. The return value of this
function is of type \highlight{ptwXY\_less\-Equal\-GreaterX} which is defined as:
\begin{verbatim}
typedef enum ptwXY_lessEqualGreaterX_e {
    ptwXY_lessEqualGreaterX_empty,          /* The object has no points. */
    ptwXY_lessEqualGreaterX_lessThan,       /* The x < xMin. */
    ptwXY_lessEqualGreaterX_equal,          /* x = x_i. */
    ptwXY_lessEqualGreaterX_between,        /* x_i < x < x_i+1. */
    ptwXY_lessEqualGreaterX_greater,        /* The x > xMax. */
    ptwXY_lessEqualGreaterX_Error           /* Something wrong with input. */
} ptwXY_lessEqualGreaterX;
\end{verbatim}
Here, xMin and xMax are the minimum and maximum $x$ values of the \highlight{ptwXYPoints} object, and
$x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$ are the $(i-1)^{th}$ and $i^{th}$ $x$ values of the \highlight{ptwXYPoints} object respectively.
